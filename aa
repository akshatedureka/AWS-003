Tasks that require root user credentials.
We recommend that you use an IAM user with appropriate permissions to perform tasks and access AWS
resources. However, you can perform the tasks listed below only when you sign in as the root user of an
account.
Tasks
• Change your account settings. This includes the account name, email address, root user password,
and root user access keys. Other account settings, such as contact information, payment currency
preference, and AWS Regions, don't require root user credentials.
• Restore IAM user permissions. If the only IAM administrator accidentally revokes their own
permissions, you can sign in as the root user to edit policies and restore those permissions.
